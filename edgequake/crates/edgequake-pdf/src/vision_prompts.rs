Follow these rules precisely:

1. TEXT PRESERVATION
   - Preserve ALL text content completely and accurately
   - Maintain human reading order
   - Correct obvious OCR-like errors only if completely certain
   - Write all output in English (translate labels only when the page language is not English; keep numeric tokens verbatim)

2. STRUCTURE
   - Use # for the main page title (at most one per page)
   - Use ## / ### / #### for sections
   - Use - for unordered lists and 1. 2. 3. for ordered lists
   - Use **bold** and *italic* to match visual emphasis

3. TABLES (critical for RAG)
   - Convert EVERY visible table to GFM pipe format with ALL cells
   - Preserve units in cell text (e.g. 42%, $1.5M, 14:04 CET)
   - Wide / multi-section tables: emit multiple GFM tables rather than dropping columns
   - If too complex for pipes, use HTML table markup — still include every readable cell

4. CHARTS / PLOTS / GRAPHS (critical for RAG — fail closed on density)
   - When the page contains a bar, line, pie, scatter, area, stacked, or multi-panel chart:
     a. Keep any visible title/caption as a heading or bold line
     b. State axis labels and units if visible
     c. MUST emit a GFM Markdown table of EVERY readable data point:
        | Category / X | Series (if any) | Value |
     d. MUST also emit a **Key values:** bullet list with verbatim numbers/percentages/callouts
     e. Prefer labeled values on the chart over estimated pixels
     f. If a value is not clearly readable, OMIT it — never invent, round from guesswork, or interpolate
     g. Year spans printed as YYYY-YY (e.g. 1981-82, 2001-02): expand into full years in Key values
        (1981, 1982 and 2001, 2002) in addition to the abbreviated form
   - Multi-panel / grid layouts (e.g. 2×3 subplots): treat EACH panel separately — repeat panel title as a row prefix or section, dump ALL readable (x, series, y) triples per panel
   - A chart page without a GFM data table is incomplete — always include the table when any number is readable

5. FIGURES / DIAGRAMS / FLOWCHARTS
   - Quote visible labels, arrow text, and numeric callouts verbatim
   - Summarize relationships briefly AFTER listing labels/numbers

6. CODE / FORMULAS
   - Code in fenced blocks with language when clear
   - Math as $inline$ / $$display$$ LaTeX

7. WHAT TO IGNORE
   - Page numbers, repeated headers/footers, decorative borders

8. OUTPUT
   - Output ONLY Markdown
   - Do NOT wrap in ```markdown fences
   - Do NOT add commentary like "Here is the conversion"
   - Start directly with page content"#;

/// - No English pin (preserve source language).

Follow these rules precisely:

1. TEXT PRESERVATION (handwriting)
   - Preserve ALL legible text completely and accurately
   - Maintain human reading order
   - Write output in the SAME LANGUAGE as the page (do not translate unless asked)
   - If a word is unreadable, write `[?]` — never invent or guess
   - If a whole line is unreadable, write `[?]` on that line

2. STRUCTURE
   - Use # for the main page title (at most one per page)
   - Use ## / ### / #### for sections
   - Use - for unordered lists and 1. 2. 3. for ordered lists
   - Use **bold** and *italic* to match visual emphasis

3. TABLES (critical for RAG)
   - Convert EVERY visible table to GFM pipe format with ALL cells
   - Hand-drawn ruled tables count as tables — transcribe them
   - Preserve units in cell text (e.g. 42%, $1.5M, 14:04 CET)
   - If too complex for pipes, use HTML table markup — still include every readable cell

4. HAND-DRAWN CHARTS / PLOTS / GRAPHS (critical for RAG)
   - Treat each chart as a SINGLE semantic unit — do NOT describe fragments
   - When the page contains a hand-drawn bar, line, pie, scatter, or area chart:
     a. Keep any visible title/caption as a heading or bold line
     b. State axis labels and units if visible

     e. Prefer labeled values on the chart over estimated pixels
     f. If a value is not clearly readable, OMIT it — never invent, round from guesswork, or interpolate

5. FIGURES / DIAGRAMS / FLOWCHARTS

Decide: is this image a REAL FIGURE with independent visual signal, or a FALSE POSITIVE?

First-principles axiom: a crop has value only when plain text / Markdown CANNOT carry

You are given a page image and a candidate Markdown transcription produced by
another model. Your ONLY job is to measure how faithfully the Markdown
reflects what is actually visible on the page.

Rules:
1. A claim in the Markdown is GROUNDED only if the corresponding words,
   numbers, or structure are visibly present on the page image.
2. INVENTED content: Markdown text with no visible counterpart on the page
   (fabricated titles, sections, values, or whole passages).
3. MISSING content: clearly legible page content absent from the Markdown.
4. Illegible handwriting marked with [?] or described as unreadable is
   HONEST, not an error — do not penalize it.
5. Judge grounding, not style. Ordering and formatting differences are fine.
6. An EMPTY or near-empty Markdown for a page with visible content is
   grounded_score 0.0 with the visible content listed as missing.
7. Never translate. Quote invented/missing content in the page's original
   language.
