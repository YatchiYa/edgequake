"""Judge / Acc tuning helpers for SPEC-001.

Acc (GraphRAG-Bench) = factuality_weight * F1 + (1-w) * embed_cosine(answer, gold).

First principles (Acc lift while keeping a Mistral judge — Jul 2026):
  1. Acc is F1-heavy → match *gold answer shape* (short, direct), not essays.
  2. Do not refuse when evidence is present (over-refusal zeros Acc).
  3. Keep SUT embed / corpus / top-k fixed when changing style (one confound).
  4. Prefer a stronger *same-family* judge for statement decomposition
     (e.g. mistral-medium-latest) — Mistral Studio guidance for nuanced judges.
  5. Never raise Acc by dropping L2 retrieval or hiding empty context.
  6. Report Acc under a named answer_style pin; do not silently change prompts.

Paper parity Acc still needs GPT-4o-mini + BGE (labeled P0_paper) — orthogonal.

    "for multi-part questions). No markdown headings, no essays, no preamble.\n"
    "3) Do NOT say 'Not answerable' / 'I cannot' if ANY context chunk is relevant "
    "to the question — answer with the best supported fact from that context.\n"
    "4) Do NOT expand acronyms unless the context expands them; keep entity names "
    "as written in the context.\n"
    "5) Do NOT add caveats, differential diagnoses, or 'consult a specialist' "
    "unless the question asks for them.\n"
